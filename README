I adapted some of this from a previous project I was working on; so, some of the code might not be optimised yet or there might be some excess code. I created the camera to allow pretty much complete movement, though we might need to restrict that. I am hoping to display the cube from an array, and I'm not sure the best way to select a color once we have done that. I think it wouldn't be to bad to create a cursor of some sort and so instead of having the camera rotate, the cursor just moves around. Upon a left click the color is stored, and whereever the cursor is at a time, we can have a box (In a GUI? or on the Opengl?) that displays the color code. Also, we'll need to trim the cube once you are inside it. I think I already have some code for that; so I'll look into it.
